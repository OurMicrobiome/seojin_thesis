The following directory contains HTML files outlining the code used to generate the results presented in Seojin Jung's senior thesis in Biology at Amherst College, "Metagenome analysis of soil-dwelling bacterial decomposers following long-term warming using a reference genome approach." The main repository is [here](https://github.com/OurMicrobiome/seojin_thesis).
